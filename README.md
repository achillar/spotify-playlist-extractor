Spotify Playlist Extractor
==========================

Bring back the freedom of choice to users. Let them export their playlist, whenever they want :)

Be fair.

## How to use
* Download the Chrome Extension from the [Google Chrome Extension gallery](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spotify-playlist-extracto/onglffcjldphmpfnpdfmngfenhmjlnnn)
* Visit [https://play.spotify.com/](play.spotify.com) and go to Playlist
* Pick up a playlist (click on it)
* Click on the "Spotify Playlist Extractor" button next to the Menu button
* Wait for it to work (if you have many items, it will scroll automatically your playlist every 5 seconds)
* When it will finish, it will open a new tab with a formatted result of your playlist items.

You're then free to choose which format to download, JSON or M3U.

Enjoy :)
